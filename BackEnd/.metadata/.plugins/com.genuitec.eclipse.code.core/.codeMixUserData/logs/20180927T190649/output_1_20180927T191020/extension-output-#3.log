[Info  - 7:10:30 PM] ESLint server is running.

Failed to load the ESLint library for the document c:\Users\Divya\Downloads\ashish1991-demo-ef5de51e25e9\src\main\resources\static\js\app\app.js

To use ESLint please install eslint by running 'npm install eslint' in the workspace folder src
or globally using 'npm install -g eslint'. You need to reopen the workspace after installing eslint.

If you are using yarn instead of npm set the setting `"eslint.packageManager": "yarn"`

Alternatively you can disable ESLint for the workspace folder src by executing the 'Disable ESLint' command.
