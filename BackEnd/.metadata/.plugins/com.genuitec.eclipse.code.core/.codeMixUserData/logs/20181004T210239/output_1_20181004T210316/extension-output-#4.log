Failed to load the TSLint library for the document c:\Users\Divya\Downloads\ashish1991-demo-ef5de51e25e9\src\main\resources\static\js\app\app.js

To use TSLint in this workspace please install tslint using 'npm install tslint' or globally using 'npm install -g tslint'.
TSLint has a peer dependency on `typescript`, make sure that `typescript` is installed as well.
You need to reopen the workspace after installing tslint.
